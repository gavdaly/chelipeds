- **Recommended laptops**: Framework, ThinkPad X/T/P series, Dell XPS, HP Dev One.
- **Desktops**: Any modern x86_64 system with UEFI.
- **GPUs**:
  - AMD → best support
  - Intel → stable (including Xe/iGPU)
  - NVIDIA → supported via proprietary drivers
- **ARM boards**: Raspberry Pi 4/5 and other aarch64 systems for the server spin.
